## Overview

The Rick and Morty App is a dynamic and interactive application that allows you to explore characters, locations, and episodes from the popular animated TV series, Rick and Morty. This app is built using Flutter and employs the Riverpod library for efficient state management. It also features infinite pagination and a live search functionality tailored to each of the three main tabs: Characters, Locations, and Episodes.

## Features

- **Three Tabs**: The app provides three main tabs at the top:
  - **Characters**: Explore a vast collection of characters from the Rick and Morty universe.
  - **Locations**: Discover various locations featured in the show.
  - **Episodes**: Dive into the episodes of the series.

- **Infinite Pagination**: Scroll through the list of characters, locations, or episodes with ease. The app seamlessly loads more data as you reach the end of the current list.

- **Live Search**: The app offers a live search feature that dynamically filters results based on your keyword input. The search is context-aware, meaning if you're in the Characters tab and search for "Rick," you'll see characters with "Rick" in their names. Similarly, if you're in the Locations tab, you'll find locations with "Rick" in their names.

- **Efficient State Management**: Riverpod is used for state management, ensuring that your app remains responsive and data stays up to date.
